## **Training the model with the FlauBERT model**

For our training, we are using the FlauBERT model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/flaubert), as described:

> The FlauBERT model was proposed in the paper FlauBERT: Unsupervised Language Model Pre-training for French by Hang Le et al. Itâ€™s a transformer model pretrained using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective (like BERT).

For the FlauBERT model, one can choose from several options:

| Model name                | Number of layers | Attention Heads | Embedding Dimension | Total Parameters |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| flaubert-small-cased      | 6                | 8               | 512                 | 54M              |
| flaubert-base-uncased     | 12               | 12              | 768                 | 137M             |
| flaubert-base-cased       | 12               | 12              | 768                 | 138M             |
| flaubert-large-cased      | 24               | 16              | 1024                | 373M             |

We will use the FlauBERT large cased model because it has greater depth, a more sophisticated attention mechanism, a larger embedding size, and a higher parameter count. Larger models such as the FlauBERT large cased typically outperform smaller ones across a variety of language understanding benchmarks, potentially offering higher accuracy.

Also, the [BERT authors recommend fine-tuning](https://github.com/google-research/bert) for four epochs with the following hyperparameter options:

- batch sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
- learning rates: 3e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5, 3e-5

Given the computational limitation, we will train our model only on 2 different different batch sizes.

### **Model with different learning rates**

Important to note that our first model is trained using the AdamW optimizer, which is a variant of the traditional Adam optimizer. AdamW incorporates a regularization technique known as [weight decay](https://github.com/tml-epfl/why-weight-decay), which is used in training neural networks to prevent overfitting. It functions by incorporating a term into the loss function that penalizes large weights.

Besides, we also employ a Linear Learning Rate Scheduler to manage the learning rate throughout the training process. This scheduler starts with a relatively high learning rate and gradually decreases it to near zero by the end of the training. This approach ensures that we begin training with aggressive learning steps and fine-tune the model parameters more delicately as training progresses.

Although this training setup does not include a warm-up phase where the learning rate would gradually ramp up before decreasing, the scheduler is configured to reduce the learning rate slightly with each training step. This gradual reduction helps in stabilizing the training as it advances.

We would like to first observe the results with this setup and may adjust these parameters further based on the outcomes of the initial training phase.

Our training was interrupted, so we couldn't fully evaluate the results for a batch size of 32. However, from what we observed, a learning rate of 5e-05 yielded the highest performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In the next stage, we will continue training our model using this learning rate and adjust the batch size to fully assess the results for batch 32.

We further trained the model on the batch size 32 over 4 epochs with the learning rate 5e-05. These are the results that we got:

| Epoch | Learning Rate | Average Loss     | Accuracy   | Precision | Recall   | F1 Score  |
|-------|---------------|------------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|

The main difference between the performance of the training on the batch 16 and 32 with the same learning rate 5e-5 is the average loss. From the graph, it's clear that the average loss for the batch size of 32 is significantly lower than that for the batch size of 16 at every epoch.

We decided to train the model over a larger number of epochs, in this case 6 with the batch 32 and the same learning rate as before.

We then submitted two models on Kaggle, from the epoch 4 and 6. While the epoch 4 had higher accuracy, it provided the result of 0.573 on Kaggle. For the model on the epoch 6th, the F1 score was higher, leading to the result of Kaggle of 0.601. This demonstrates that relying solely on accuracy might not give a comprehensive assessment of a model's performance. Therefore, it is crucial to consider multiple metrics.

We also experimented and changed the number of epochs to 4, 6 and 8. However, 6 epochs resulted in the highest accuracy of the model and F1 value.
